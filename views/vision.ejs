              Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of India has established ‘MHRD’s Innovation Cell (MIC)’ to systematically foster the culture of Innovation amongst all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The primary mandate of MIC is to encourage, inspire and nurture young students by supporting them to
               work with new ideas and transform them into prototypes while they are informative years.
            </p>

           
            <p  class="font-italic mt-2">
              MIC has envisioned encouraging creation of ‘Institution’s Innovation Council (IICs)’ across selected HEIs. A network of these IICs will be established to promote innovation in the Institution through multitudinous modes leading to an innovation promotion eco-system in the campuses.

            <p>“Advice is like a snow flake- the softer it falls, the longer it dwells upon, and the deeper it sinks into mind.” My only advice to all our members is to not only dream but also achieve, become a perfect combination of a doer and a dreamer. One needs three things to create a successful start-up: to start with good people, to make something people actually want, to spend as little money as possible, and this cell is place where your ideas can build up in reality, if you try.

            <h4>FROM THE CONVENOR'S DESK</h4>
            <p>Nurturing ideas and inspiring innovation are the key elements behind a successful startup and this purpose is served by our Innovation, Incubation and Star-up cell. The cell’ s work is commendable and inspirational for the students, later to achieve brilliance in the future. The cell gives them the courage to present their ideas among people and they also get to know and meet different other start-ups out there in the world which motivates them.</p>
